# 🤖 Chatbot v1 — Rule-Based Command Line Assistant

## 🧠 Project Overview

This is **Chatbot Version 1**, a **rule-based conversational assistant** built in Python.

It operates in a simple command-line interface (CLI) and responds to predefined messages using a dictionary of rules.

The goal of this version is to **lay the foundation for future intelligent chatbot systems**, following good software practices like:

- Modular code (using `engine/` package)
- Separation of logic and data
- CLI interaction with a user
- Project structure, `venv`, and Git readiness

---

## 🛠️ Features in Version 1

- 🔹 Rule-based reply system (pattern → response)
- 🔹 ASCII Art welcome banner (using `pyfiglet`)
- 🔹 Continuous interaction loop
- 🔹 Graceful exit with `exit` command
- 🔹 Modular Python design

## ❓ Why This Project Is Simple (on Purpose)

This version is intentionally basic because:

1. ✅ It helps build **project structure discipline** (folders, modules, imports)
2. ✅ Teaches how to separate **engine logic** from interaction code
3. ✅ Gives experience in **file handling, CLI, and simple parsing**
4. ✅ Sets the stage for layering **AI and NLP features** in the next versions

Rather than jumping straight into advanced tools, this project ensures a **clear, clean foundation**.
